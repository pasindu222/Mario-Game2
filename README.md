# JavaScript Game Hosting with Automated Deployment

## Overview

This project demonstrates my journey into enhancing my DevOps skills by hosting a JavaScript game on AWS Cloud and implementing automated deployment using GitHub Actions.

## Features

- **Development:**
  - Created a JavaScript game using VSCode.
  
- **Hosting:**
  - Deployed the game on an AWS instance for robust and scalable infrastructure.

- **Nginx Configuration:**
  - Configured Nginx as a reverse proxy to direct traffic from the default HTTP port (80) to the application running on port 3000. This allows access to the game using just the server's IP address.

- **Automated Deployment:**
  - Integrated GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Every push to the repository triggers a workflow that deploys the latest game version to the AWS instance.

## Skills and Tools

- **Programming:** JavaScript
- **IDE:** VSCode
- **Cloud Services:** AWS (EC2)
- **Web Server:** Nginx
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
