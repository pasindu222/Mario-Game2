For this project, I aimed to deepen my understanding of DevOps practices and Git tools, specifically focusing on continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). Here’s an overview of what I achieved:

##Development:

Developed a JavaScript game using VSCode, ensuring a smooth and efficient coding environment.
Hosting:

Deployed the game on an AWS instance, utilizing the robust and scalable infrastructure provided by AWS.
Nginx Configuration:

Configured Nginx as a reverse proxy to route traffic from the default HTTP port to the application running on port 3000. This setup allows the game to be accessed via the server’s IP address without specifying a port number.
Automated Deployment:

Integrated GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process. Every time I push changes to the repository, GitHub Actions triggers a workflow to deploy the latest version of the game to the AWS instance seamlessly.
Skills and Tools:

Programming: JavaScript
IDE: VSCode
Cloud Services: AWS (EC2)
Web Server: Nginx
CI/CD: GitHub Actions
Version Control: Git, GitHub
This project has been instrumental in honing my DevOps skills, particularly in the areas of cloud computing, server configuration, and automation. It represents my commitment to continuous learning and my passion for integrating development and operations to streamline processes and improve efficiency.
